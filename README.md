This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Deploy on Netlify

1. Push this project to GitHub or another Git provider.
2. In Netlify, choose **Add new site** and import the repository.
3. Keep the detected build command as `npm run build` and deploy.
4. Add `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` in Netlify site environment variables when gallery data is required.

## Supabase shared uploads

Run [`supabase/schema.sql`](supabase/schema.sql) in the Supabase SQL Editor. It creates the public `gallery` table, the shared `site_content` table, the `temple-media` storage bucket, and policies that allow everyone to read published content while only signed-in Supabase users can upload, edit, or delete it.

Create the admin user in Supabase under **Authentication → Users**, then use that email and password in the website admin login. Main branding, posts, pages, categories, media settings, bank details, event settings, puja settings, and music tracks now sync through `site_content` after an authenticated admin edit. Browser localStorage remains as a fallback for offline/local use.
